89	Due to the reliance of QA systems on IR technology, the relationship between them is an important area of study.	One of the recent trends in statistical machine translation (SMT) is the popularity of models that use syntactic information to help solve problems of long-distance reordering between the source and target language text.	Varigrams(CITE-p-21-3-2) are used in this work, and to make LMs trained with each approach comparable, the varigrams have been grown to roughly sizes of 5 million counts.	is an important area	recent trends in	are used in this	the importance of the topic	Brief introduction to the methodology	P06-2068_s-2-1-3-0	P13-4016_s-2-1-0-0	P07-1012_s-5-1-1-7	1
90	The task of stance detection – the automatic classification of stance expressed in text – has been attracting increasing interest, as it is of practical interest to many stakeholders, ranging from political bodies to companies.	Language model (LM) plays a critical role in statistical machine translation (SMT).	Here, we adopt the definition and the datasets from SemEval–2016 Task 3 (CITE-p-10-3-9) on “Community Question Answering”, focusing on subtask A (Question-Comment Similarity) only.	has been attracting	plays a critical role in	adopt the definition	the importance of the topic	Explanation or definition of terms or notations	S16-1075_s-2-1-0-1	D12-1047_s-2-1-0-0	P16-2075_s-2-1-1-0	1
91	Dependency parsing is a basic technology for processing Japanese and has been the subject of much research.	Therefore, emotion classification has been attracting more and more attention, e.g., CITE-p-11-1-3, CITE-p-11-1-12.	While this process seems essential to scientific publication, it is often a subject of debate.	has been the subject of	has been attracting	subject of debate	the importance of the topic	Controversy within the field	P06-1105_s-2-1-0-0	P15-2127_s-2-1-0-4	N18-1149_s-2-1-0-1	1

Local coherence is undoubtedly necessary for global coherence and has received considerable attention in Computational Linguistics.

93	Neuroimaging studies have provided evidence that metaphorical language elicits more emotional activation of the human brain than literal language in the same context (Citron and Goldberg, 2014).	In other work, soft or hard constraints on the posterior during the E-step have been explored in order to improve performance.

94	Previous research has established that recognizing people’s goals is essential for narrative text understanding and story comprehension (CITE-p-22-3-11, CITE-p-22-3-13, CITE-p-22-3-3, CITE-p-22-1-8, CITE-p-22-3-1).	Recently, several attempts have been made to classify documents from biomedical domain (CITE-p-12-1-5).

95	It is well established that the MEANT family of metrics correlates better with human adequacy judgments than commonly used MT evaluation metrics (CITE-p-13-3-12, CITE-p-13-3-9, CITE-p-13-3-17).	So far, various supervised learning approaches have been explored in this field (CITE-p-14-1-1, CITE-p-14-1-7).

96	So far, various supervised learning approaches have been explored in this field (CITE-p-14-1-1, CITE-p-14-1-7).	Apart from the cost of manually authoring generation rules, previous research has found that human-authored rules can result in ‘too much information [being] given too quickly’ (CITE-p-7-3-11), which can be addressed by conversational padding.	This paper describes a novel approach for modeling such conditional probabilities.	have been explored in	previous research has found	this paper describes	what is already done by past work	The aim of the paper	P07-2040_s-2-1-2-1	N10-1048_s-2-8-1-0	P11-2110_s-2-5-0-0	1

98	Several different theories have been proposed as to how people find the correct relation with which to link the constituent nouns.	So far, various supervised learning approaches have been explored in this field (CITE-p-14-1-1, CITE-p-14-1-7).	At the level of methodology, our work adopts the approach to model selection proposed by CITE-p-16-3-12, which is described in detail in section 4.	theories have been proposed	have been explored in	the approach to * is	what is already done by past work	Brief introduction to the methodology	P04-3011_s-2-1-0-4	P07-2040_s-2-1-2-1	Q14-1041_s-2-6-3-0	1

100	The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows.	This paper begins to fill this gap by defining TierBased Strictly Local (TSL) languages, which generalize the Strictly Local languages (CITE-p-13-3-6).	In this paper, we argue that each of these components are interdependent and should be modeled simultaneously.	the remaining part of the paper is organized as follows	this paper begins	in this paper we argue that	Outline of the paper	The aim of the paper	D17-1070_s-2-6-1-0	P11-2011_s-2-3-1-0	P12-1035_s-2-1-0-5	0.75

102	The remainder of this paper is divided into the following sections.	This paper begins to address this problem by building a joint model of both parsing and named entity recognition.	We adopt the definition from CITE-p-21-1-0 who defines a collocational expression as “a syntactic and semantic unit whose exact and unambiguous meaning or connotation cannot be derived directly from the meaning or connotation of its components”.	this paper is divided into	this paper begins	adopt the definition	Outline of the paper	Explanation or definition of terms or notations	P17-1075_s-2-11-1-0	N09-1037_s-2-4-1-0	P06-2084_s-2-1-3-2	1
103	Since labeling is not a concern of this paper, we simply label new nodes with X-bar where X here is the parent label.	A general comparison of MACAON with these tools is beyond the scope of this paper.

104	Hence, it is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss them at length.	It is not the intention of this paper to argue for or against compositionality in semantic representations.	There is some consensus that the order of prenominal modifiers in noun phrases is governed in part by semantic constraints, but there is no agreement on the exact constraints necessary to specify consistent orderings for any given set of modifiers.	is beyond the scope of this	is not * of this paper	there is no agreement	The limitation of the research	Limitation or lack of past work	N04-2008_s-4-1-0-3	E12-1005_s-2-1-3-2	N10-1085_s-2-1-0-3	1
