# An Evaluation Dataset for Identifying Communicative Functions of Sentences in English Scholarly Papers

The dataset consists of three sets of tsv files. The usage is explained in [our paper](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339658767_An_Evaluation_Dataset_for_Identifying_Communicative_Functions_of_Sentences_in_English_Scholarly_Papers).

0. Accuracy of human annotation

### sentences

0. Communicative function
0. The core FE
