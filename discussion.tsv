Our approach and results are significant from several perspectives: they provide a strong approach to identifying posts indicating a risk of self-harm in social media; they demonstrate a means for large scale public mental health studies surrounding the state of depression; and they demonstrate the possibility of sensitive applications in the context of clinical care, where clinicians could be notified if the activities of their patients suggest they are at risk of self-harm.

12	World knowledge, especially obtained from Wikipedia, has shown to be useful in previous studies.	Unlike prior work that has focused on inferring “life trajectories” from categorical survey data, we learn relevant structure in an unsupervised manner directly from text, opening the door to applying this method to a broad set of biographies beyond Wikipedia (including full-text books from the Internet Archive or Hathi Trust, and other encyclopedic biographies as well).

13	4 A possible explanation for these disparate findings is a systematic variation of annotator numbers employed in the domains (see Table 5).

14	But it may be that something more subtle is happening.	We find that this difference can be explained by the different coverage of the paraphrasing resources.

15	We think the reason for this is because a comprehensive summary was made by latent topics.	However, the results suggest that the proposed method offers a more affordable approach that provides reasonable coverage and quality, even if individual general knowledge sources may be limited in themselves.

16	It could be argued that the recognition incentive was motivating players in the free condition and thus some incentive was required.	This might be explained by the fact that SMS messages tend to be more direct, whereas the same tweet can express, or show signs of, contradictory sentiments.

17	Both of these results however may be due to limitations of the current method.	A possible explanation for this is that the SE07 dataset appears to be somewhere in the middle between EL09 and GE15 in terms of substitute variance.	What is surprising, moreover, is that diversity-enabled ProbDTs are superior in performance to their non-diversity counterparts (with a notable exception for SSDT at MATH-w-11-1-2-88), which suggests that selecting marginal sentences is an important part of generating a summary.	may be due to	a possible explanation for	what is surprising	Explanation for the findings	Unexpected outcome	D09-1065_s-9-4-1-1	P16-1012_s-10-11-1-10	P02-1059_s-11-1-1-4	0.6

19	Alternatively, the absence of correlations may be explained by the fact that not all perception necessarily leads to a change in production, as CITE-p-16-1-11 found.	Taking the union of all techniques does not yield additional gains: this might be explained by the fact that incorrect predictions are proportionnally more present and consequently have a greater impact when combining techniques without weighting them, possibly at the level of each prediction.

22	This may explain why only two of the top seven word association features use min values.	Of course, our results need to be interpreted with prudence, since the automatic classifiers for detecting SOEs and CF on SOEs in the whole dataset are far from perfect.

The identification accuracy was found to be as high as approximately 36%.	was unexpected	what is surprising	was found to	Unexpected outcome	Restatement of the results	E12-3001_s-15-3-2-1	P02-1059_s-11-1-1-4	P06-2045_s-2-4-6-5	1
47	What is surprising is that the judgments of the group, aggregated in this way, correspond more closely to expert opinion than (in many cases) the best individual annotators.	It was unexpected for verb disambiguation results to be as strong as nouns because a previous study using Web Selectors found noun sense disambiguation clearly stronger than verb sense disambiguation on a coarse-grained corpus (CITE-p-8-1-10).	These findings suggest that the target topic, having a known narrative frame, was the most useful piece of information for participants in ordering tweets.	what is surprising	was unexpected	these findings suggest that	Unexpected outcome	Suggestion of hypotheses	P09-1101_s-17-3-1-1	S10-1088_s-5-1-2-2	N18-4019_s-6-12-2-0	0.8
48	On the other hand, it is somewhat surprising that the three information-status classifiers have yielded coreference systems that perform at essentially the same level of performance.	Our approach is surprisingly effective in learning from free-form language.	Moreover, the results obtained with those methods are quite encouraging.	it is somewhat surprising that	surprisingly	encouraging	Unexpected outcome	Comments on the findings	D11-1099_s-19-5-0-4	P18-1029_s-13-1-0-0	P91-1027_s-9-1-0-2	1
49	We show that, contrary to expectations, the deletion of non-subsective adjectives from a sentence does not necessarily result in non-entailment.	It is somewhat surprising that we did not achieve reliable performance gains which were seen in the related work described above.	Automatic identification of user intent also has important implications in building intelligent conversational QA systems.	contrary to expectations	it is somewhat surprising that	important implications	Unexpected outcome	Implications of the findings	S16-2014_s-7-1-0-1	S12-1031_s-17-1-1-0	P06-2008_s-12-1-2-0	1
50	CITE-p-27-3-4 also reported high accuracy (95.8 UAS and 94.6 LAS) by using a converter.	Regarding the set of word embeddings, we found that higher-dimensional embeddings provide better performance, which is in accordance with what CITE-p-16-1-15 found.

51	In contrast to earlier studies, our basic method showed a significantly improved communication rate over no prediction.	Overall, these results corroborate previous studies suggesting that highly precise sense annotations can be obtained by leveraging multiple languages (CITE-p-15-1-17, CITE-p-15-1-18).	We believe that these results are significant as well as insightful.	in contrast to earlier	these results corroborate	results are significant	comparison of the results and past work	Comments on the findings	N07-2044_s-9-4-1-0	S13-2040_s-12-17-3-7	P07-1014_s-10-6-1-0	1
52	The worse results on biomedical scientific papers from a different source also corroborates our finding that hedge cues can be highly ambiguous.	Regarding the set of word embeddings, we found that higher-dimensional embeddings provide better performance, which is in accordance with what CITE-p-16-1-15 found.	The higher the number of annotators who are able to agree, the less bias and distortion can be expected in the data and the more stable and comparable the results are likely to be.	corroborates	in accordance with * cite-	results are likely to	comparison of the results and past work	Explanation for the findings	P08-1033_s-20-3-7-0	P16-3010_s-14-1-1-1	J11-4004_s-11-23-2-3	1
53	This accords with an understated result of Boston et al.’s eye-tracking study (2008a): a richer language model predicts eye movements during reading better than an oversimplified one.

54	Our proposed MATH-w-7-4-0-20 kernel obtains an F-score that is higher than that of the previous state of the art.	This observation is consistent with earlier findings by Purandare and Pedersen for general English text.

55	As we have seen, training on source language x and testing on source language y provides us with a good estimation of the distance between languages, in accordance with what we find in standard works on typology (cf. CITE-p-16-1-7).	Our proposed MATH-w-7-4-0-20 kernel obtains an F-score that is higher than that of the previous state of the art.	The reason for this is that a completeness proof along the above lines runs into problems for such extended logics.	in accordance with * cite-	than that of * previous	the reason for this is	comparison of the results and past work	Explanation for the findings	P11-1132_s-15-1-4-3	N13-1093_s-7-4-0-1	E93-1044_s-10-1-0-2	1
56	Overall, these results corroborate previous studies suggesting that highly precise sense annotations can be obtained by leveraging multiple languages (CITE-p-15-1-17, CITE-p-15-1-18).	More generally, this study confirms that insights drawn from the field of theoretical translation studies, namely the dual claim according to which (1) translations as such differ from originals, and (2) translations from different source languages differ from each other, can be verified experimentally and contribute to the performance of machine translation.	Thus our aim of evaluating our hybrid system against THYME corpus which was developed using Stanford TokensRegex Framework and Stanford CRF Classifier was successful.	these results corroborate	this study confirms	was successful	comparison of the results and past work	Comments on the findings	S13-2040_s-12-17-3-7	D11-1034_s-12-3-2-0	S16-1191_s-7-7-2-5	1

The precision scores are in line with the scores reported by CITE-p-20-3-11 in a similar experiment discussed under related work.	The most interesting finding is that these dominance relations encode sufficient information to enable the derivation of discourse structures that are almost indistinguishable from those built by human annotators.	this study confirms	are in line with	the most interesting finding is	comparison of the results and past work	Restatement of the results	J12-4004_s-13-6-1-0	P06-2111_s-16-6-2-0	N03-1030_s-14-1-1-0	0.8
58	The results obtained are in line with those obtained by the other participants and they encourage us to continue working on this problem.	This accords with an understated result of Boston et al.’s eye-tracking study (2008a): a richer language model predicts eye movements during reading better than an oversimplified one.

60	We can simply mention that the errors we observed are consistent with previous systems based on Harris's hypothesis (see (CITE-p-8-1-9) and CITE-p-8-1-7 for a longer discussion).	Not only is our parser more accurate, but the learned grammar is also significantly smaller than that of previous work.
