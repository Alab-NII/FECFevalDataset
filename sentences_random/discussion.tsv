Explanation for the findings	the domains see Table	4 A possible explanation for these disparate findings is a systematic variation of annotator numbers employed in the domains (see Table 5).	J11-4004_s-11-20-0-0
Suggestion of future work	a topic-comment structure	7 One explanation for this result could be that developers (or development tools) treat axioms as having a topic-comment structure, where the topic is usually the first argument; we intend to investigate this possibility in a further study.	P10-2024_s-6-6-0-0
Explanation for the findings	GE15 in terms of	A possible explanation for this is that the SE07 dataset appears to be somewhere in the middle between EL09 and GE15 in terms of substitute variance.	P16-1012_s-10-11-1-10
Unexpected outcome	impact	Also, the impact of imperfect temporal data is surprisingly minimal.	P07-2044_s-10-1-1-2
Explanation for the findings	the fact that not	Alternatively, the absence of correlations may be explained by the fact that not all perception necessarily leads to a change in production, as CITE-p-16-1-11 found.	N18-2048_s-14-1-2-2
Restatement of the results	yield significantly better	Although based on much more labeled training data, these experiments did not yield significantly better results.	P02-1045_s-12-1-1-6
Implications of the findings	that the system does	An implication of this property is that the system does not try to match the input utterance to the closest word (by some measure of distance) contained in the dictionary but rather tries to find its most probable spelling.	J96-3003_s-15-3-1-2

comparison of the results and past work	in standard works on	As we have seen, training on source language x and testing on source language y provides us with a good estimation of the distance between languages, in accordance with what we find in standard works on typology (cf. CITE-p-16-1-7).	P11-1132_s-15-1-4-3
Implications of the findings	Automatic identification	Automatic identification of user intent also has important implications in building intelligent conversational QA systems.	P06-2008_s-12-1-2-0

Suggestion of hypotheses	results in Table 6	From the ROUGE results in Table 6 we can infer that while REAPER outperformed ASRL on the query focused task, however it is notable that both systems under performed when compared to the top system from the DUC2006 conference.	D14-1075_s-19-1-0-0
Suggestion of hypotheses	From the results in Table	From the results in Table 2, it can be hypothesized that Novelty is best captured at sentence scoring stage of summarization, rather than at ranking or summary extraction.	N10-3003_s-13-1-0-8
Suggestion of future work	topic differences and audience size	Further work is required to reconcile our results with prior work on topic differences and audience size (CITE-p-12-3-2).	N18-2022_s-10-1-2-1
Suggestion of hypotheses	during sentence comprehension	Hence, these results provide additional evidence in support of surprisal as a reliable measure of cognitive processing difficulty during sentence comprehension (CITE-p-19-6-5).	P13-2152_s-17-1-0-1
Explanation for the findings	and testing corpora	However, a few comparisons with Aslin’s et al. (1996) data in Table 1 may be useful, although they should be interpreted cautiously given the differences in the training and testing corpora between their study and this one.	N04-2008_s-10-1-0-1
Suggestion of future work	to investigate	However, additional studies are needed to investigate why huge improvements in AER result in relatively smaller improvements in BLEU scores.	N06-1013_s-13-1-2-1

Background provided by past work	sufficient position embeddings also	In contrast to prior work that has assumed that the sequenceof-character information captured by character ngrams is sufficient, position embeddings also capture sequenceof-ngram information.	E17-1074_s-14-1-0-2
Restatement of the results	to the embedding	In our experiments, the distance feature was found to be less important compared to the embedding features.	N18-1082_s-6-10-3-3
Suggestion of hypotheses	to other treebanks that are	It can be hypothesized that this finding carries over to other treebanks that are annotated with flat structures.	P03-1013_s-20-1-4-0
Explanation for the findings	the recognition incentive was motivating	It could be argued that the recognition incentive was motivating players in the free condition and thus some incentive was required.	P14-1122_s-16-1-0-3
Unexpected outcome	we did not achieve reliable	It is somewhat surprising that we did not achieve reliable performance gains which were seen in the related work described above.	S12-1031_s-17-1-1-0
Unexpected outcome	as strong	It was unexpected for verb disambiguation results to be as strong as nouns because a previous study using Web Selectors found noun sense disambiguation clearly stronger than verb sense disambiguation on a coarse-grained corpus (CITE-p-8-1-10).	S10-1088_s-5-1-2-2

Explanation for the findings	in the whole dataset	Of course, our results need to be interpreted with prudence, since the automatic classifiers for detecting SOEs and CF on SOEs in the whole dataset are far from perfect.	K16-1011_s-17-1-1-3
Comments on the findings	perhaps	On the one hand, the overall results are perhaps disappointing.	S16-1182_s-15-1-1-0

Suggestion of future work	One interesting topic	One interesting topic for future research is exploration in planning.	P18-1203_s-13-1-1-0
Comments on the findings	a strong approach	Our approach and results are significant from several perspectives: they provide a strong approach to identifying posts indicating a risk of self-harm in social media; they demonstrate a means for large scale public mental health studies surrounding the state of depression; and they demonstrate the possibility of sensitive applications in the context of clinical care, where clinicians could be notified if the activities of their patients suggest they are at risk of self-harm.

Restatement of the results	or character-based features	Our preliminary experiments did not show noticeable improvements from bigram or character-based features, but it is possible that higher-level features such as morphological, part-of-speech or syntactic features could yield further performance gains.

Implications of the findings	of achieving states	Such suboptimality averagely balanced by the feature representation raises the possibility of achieving states that have a high-quality summary with a low score, since we do not have a genuine score function.	D12-1024_s-23-1-2-3
Unexpected outcome	not	Surprisingly, this natural approach does not work, even for simple examples.	P98-2227_s-11-1-0-3
Explanation for the findings	does not yield	Taking the union of all techniques does not yield additional gains: this might be explained by the fact that incorrect predictions are proportionnally more present and consequently have a greater impact when combining techniques without weighting them, possibly at the level of each prediction.
