Also, in contrast to CITE-p-14-1-21, we respect the consistency constraint discussed in Section 1.	has highlighted	has revealed	in contrast to cite-	General introduction to past work	Comparison between the present and past work	E17-1062_s-3-1-1-0	J96-3004_s-2-7-2-2	E14-1009_s-3-1-2-6	1
40	Similar to previous findings (CITE-p-11-3-1), we observe that our specialized embeddings outperform language-only as well as other multimodal embeddings in the downstream tasks of interest.	A large amount of literature has been published on parallel resource mining from the web.	As noted by CITE-p-16-1-5, such models should capture influences of the verb such as its semantic properties, its overall frequency, and its frequency in various constructions.	previous findings	has been published on	as noted by cite-	General introduction to past work	What is found or suggested in past work	D17-1097_s-3-1-0-5	D14-1129_s-3-1-0-0	D16-1010_s-3-1-0-1	1

42	Similarly, there is a small body of literature that addresses nominal semantic role labelling (CITE-p-18-1-12) and nominal subcategorization frames (CITE-p-18-3-10).	Compared with a fair amount of works on English negation and speculation identification, unfortunately, few works has been published on Chinese.

43	Amongst others, CITE-p-26-3-15 also investigated ways of splitting katakana noun compounds.	CITE-p-16-1-1 used a graph based method, and CITE-p-16-3-0 used a rule-based method.

44	Learning to follow instructions was studied extensively with structured environment representations, including with semantic parsing (CITE-p-13-1-14, CITE-p-13-3-1, CITE-p-13-3-2, CITE-p-13-1-7), alignment models (CITE-p-13-1-1), reinforcement learning (CITE-p-13-1-10, CITE-p-13-1-12, CITE-p-13-5-12), and neural network models (CITE-p-13-3-14).	The algorithm by CITE-p-15-3-1 identifies coreferring targets in newspaper articles.	This research is also related to early examples of learning bilingual lexicons using monolingual corpora (CITE-p-14-3-12, CITE-p-14-3-4); the latter used CCA to find matched word pairs.	was studied extensively	cite- * identifies	early examples	What is done in past work	History of the related topics	D17-1107_s-4-1-0-0	P10-2049_s-4-4-2-1	N15-1028_s-11-3-2-0	0.5
45	Specifically, CITE-p-13-3-5; CITE-p-13-3-23 uses an LSTM for the sentence encoder, while CITE-p-13-3-7 uses a bag-of-words to represent sentences.	Also, CITE-p-20-3-0 conducted human experiments with a subset of their corpus.

46	CITE-p-22-1-5 use around 9K emails from 108 gender identified authors.	Researchers have considered tag-tag relationships for personalized query expansion, by selecting the most related tags from a user’s profile (CITE-p-18-1-0, CITE-p-18-1-2).	Large-scale studies have revealed subtle dynamics in conversations such as coordination or style matching effects (CITE-p-18-3-1, CITE-p-18-1-10) as well as expressions of social power and status (Bramsen et al., 2011; Danescu-NiculescuMizil et al., 2012).	cite- * identified	researchers have considered	have revealed	What is done in past work	What is found or suggested in past work	D14-1211_s-3-1-4-3	D16-1067_s-6-1-0-2	Q16-1033_s-3-1-2-1	0.5
47	A few previous approaches have attempted to interface sentence compression with summarization.	CITE-p-16-5-19 identified claims and other argument components in student essays.	Together, these experiments suggest that syllable weight eventually encodes everything about word segmentation that dictionary stress does, and that any advantage that syllable weight has over observing dictionary stress is entirely redundant with knowledge of word-final codas.	have attempted to	cite- * identified	together these	What is done in past work	Summary of past work	D10-1050_s-3-1-0-2	D17-1217_s-3-1-1-6	D14-1091_s-4-9-1-0	1
48	CITE-p-21-1-14 considers only borrowability as far as the lexicon is concerned.	The algorithm by CITE-p-15-3-1 identifies coreferring targets in newspaper articles.

49	Significant improvements are reported using this approach but the need for large manually aligned data is a bottleneck.	Previous studies have explored the effect of translation resources such as bilingual wordlists or parallel corpora on CLIR performance.	For a broader perspective, several survey papers are available (CITE-p-19-3-9, CITE-p-19-3-15, CITE-p-19-3-1, CITE-p-19-3-17).	using this approach	previous studies have explored	a broader perspective	What is done in past work	Comparison among past work	N06-1013_s-12-3-1-1	P06-1075_s-4-1-0-0	D15-1007_s-3-1-0-2	1
50	CITE-p-17-1-2 have examined cultural bias based on Wikipedia’s NPOV policy.	CITE-p-16-1-1 used a graph based method, and CITE-p-16-3-0 used a rule-based method.	As such, pattern-based extraction mechanisms have been found to yield good citation extraction results (CITE-p-13-1-5).	have examined	cite- * used	have been found to	What is done in past work	What is found or suggested in past work	P13-1162_s-14-1-2-3	P13-1165_s-3-1-4-1	P18-4004_s-3-1-1-2	1

52	CITE-p-17-3-16 carried out a comprehensive empirical study corroborating these findings with large and diverse datasets.	CITE-p-43-3-1 compared nine user-network-based approaches targeting Twitter, controlling data conditions.	That is, unlike CITE-p-13-1-5 we do not learn word embeddings and unlike CITE-p-13-5-0 we are not restricted to input sentences.	cite- * carried out	cite- * compared	unlike cite-	What is done in past work	Comparison between the present and past work	E17-1101_s-3-1-5-1	P17-1116_s-5-1-0-6	K17-1040_s-3-3-8-4	1
53	CITE-p-22-1-7 identifies antonyms by looking for pre-identified phrases in corpus datasets.	(CITE-p-13-1-5) provides information about the types of attributes and classification features.	For a broader perspective, several survey papers are available (CITE-p-19-3-9, CITE-p-19-3-15, CITE-p-19-3-1, CITE-p-19-3-17).	cite- * identifies	cite- * provides	a broader perspective	What is done in past work	Comparison among past work	D14-1161_s-6-1-0-1	P17-3004_s-3-5-1-2	D15-1007_s-3-1-0-2	1
54	Several studies have investigated the use of symbolic representations (such as dependency trees) to guide the composition of distributed representations (CITE-p-20-3-3, CITE-p-20-3-21, CITE-p-20-3-4, CITE-p-20-3-13).	A number of researchers have considered the problem of projecting linguistic annotations from the source to the target language in a parallel corpus (Yarowsky et al., 2001; Hwa et al., 2005; CITE-p-16-3-2; CITE-p-16-5-9; CITE-p-16-5-3; CITE-p-16-3-14).

55	CITE-p-20-3-20 used a set of 40 papers, CITE-p-20-3-7 used 21 and CITE-p-20-5-7 used only 9 papers.	CITE-p-25-5-18 and CITE-p-25-3-12 decompose the problem over mentions and select the candidate that maximizes their relatedness score, which includes relations to all other mentions.

56	Turning to parsing, most work has utilized uncertainty sampling (CITE-p-20-1-18, CITE-p-20-1-9, CITE-p-20-1-17).	Several studies have investigated the chances of predicting continuous participation in SNSs such as MOOC and health care forum (Rosé and Siemens, 2014; Kloft et al., 2014; Ramesh et al., 2014; Sadeque et al., 2015).

57	Several researchers have considered text classification tasks similar to action-item detection.	The work in (CITE-p-15-1-7, CITE-p-15-1-5) also examines the impact of segmentation on offline speech translation of talks.	Dagan et al.

58	In particular, the work of CITE-p-21-1-9 highlights some of the fundamental issues of strong stemming, including the potential positive effect of light stemmers like the S-removal stemmer.	CITE-p-14-1-16 analyzed the impact of automatic translation on sentiment analysis.

59	Also, CITE-p-20-3-0 conducted human experiments with a subset of their corpus.	A purely graph-based approach to WSD was presented by Agirre, de Lacalle, and CITE-p-31-1-0.	This is reflected in the query focused tasks run in the Document Understanding Conference (DUC) and Text Analysis Conference (TAC) over the past decade.	cite- * conducted	was presented by	over the past decade	What is done in past work	History of the related topics	P14-3010_s-4-1-1-0	J17-3004_s-29-4-0-3	D14-1075_s-3-4-2-1	1
60	Previous studies have explored unsupervised induction of salient content structure in newswire texts (CITE-p-25-1-1), temporal graph representations (CITE-p-25-1-2), and storyline extraction and event summarization (CITE-p-25-3-12).	CITE-p-17-1-8 and Baron et al. (1998) carried out sentence unit (SU) and disfluency prediction as separate tasks.

61	In a recent study closer to our work, CITE-p-12-3-1 use high-order part-of-speech ngram to model and detect learner errors on the sentence level.	The problem of user life event extraction was first studied by Li and Cardie’s (2014).

63	Work on automated genre classification was first carried out by CITE-p-15-1-19.	CITE-p-19-5-16 compared attention based input representations and attention based pooling.

64	Scientific article summarization was first studied by (CITE-p-18-5-6) in which they trained a supervised Naive Bayes classifier to select informative content for the summary.	Specifically, CITE-p-13-3-5; CITE-p-13-3-23 uses an LSTM for the sentence encoder, while CITE-p-13-3-7 uses a bag-of-words to represent sentences.

65	In a recent experiment with a wide-coverage parsing system utilizing a lexicalist grammatical framework, Briscoe & CITE-p-13-5-3 observed that half of parse failures on unseen test data were caused by inaccurate subcategorization information in the ANLT dictionary.	In an analysis of their data they found implicit arguments to be very frequent, as their annotation added 65% more arguments to NomBank.

73	Sun and Jurafsky (2004) did the preliminary work on Chinese SRL without any large semantically annotated corpus and produced promising results.	CITE-p-23-3-17 uses convolution over embedding matrices for unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams, while CITE-p-23-1-16 uses just unigrams.

81	A recent study by CITE-p-8-3-16 takes a different approach towards cross-annotation evaluation.	To add lexical information, CITE-p-17-5-10 used multilingual word clusters, while CITE-p-17-5-17, CITE-p-17-3-8, CITE-p-17-5-7 and CITE-p-17-3-9 used multilingual word embeddings.	Contrary to previous findings, CITE-p-23-3-0 find no advantage in decoding neural activity patterns associated with concrete words for image-based models.	a recent study	cite- * used	previous findings	What is done in past work	General introduction to past work	D11-1036_s-3-14-0-0	Q16-1031_s-14-1-0-3	D17-1114_s-3-1-4-4	0.75

83	CITE-p-25-5-18 and CITE-p-25-3-12 decompose the problem over mentions and select the candidate that maximizes their relatedness score, which includes relations to all other mentions.	The problem of user life event extraction was first studied by Li and Cardie’s (2014).	Interestingly, in almost every paper in our survey the researchers chose to analyze their results using more than one evaluation measure, with an average of 2.34 (ACL) and 2.1 (TACL).	cite- * mentions	was first studied by	every paper	What is done in past work	Comparison among past work	P16-1059_s-14-1-0-1	D14-1214_s-16-4-1-0	P18-1128_s-12-3-1-3	0.5

89	Similarly, CITE-p-20-3-9 utilized a SVM classifier to recognize opinionated sentences.	Interestingly, in almost every paper in our survey the researchers chose to analyze their results using more than one evaluation measure, with an average of 2.34 (ACL) and 2.1 (TACL).	Learning to follow instructions was studied extensively with structured environment representations, including with semantic parsing (CITE-p-13-1-14, CITE-p-13-3-1, CITE-p-13-3-2, CITE-p-13-1-7), alignment models (CITE-p-13-1-1), reinforcement learning (CITE-p-13-1-10, CITE-p-13-1-12, CITE-p-13-5-12), and neural network models (CITE-p-13-3-14).	similarly cite-	every paper	was studied extensively	Comparison among past work	What is done in past work	D12-1036_s-17-1-2-2	P18-1128_s-12-3-1-3	D17-1107_s-4-1-0-0	0.75
90	Conversely, CITE-p-8-3-2 developed a technique to optimize the more desirable reverse property of the word types having a sparse posterior distribution over tags.	Likewise, (CITE-p-19-1-1) use a WSD classifier to generate a probability distribution of phrase pairs and to build a local language model.
